        <p>Man running from cops stops to pet cats, goes to jail kitty power or claw your carpet in places everyone can see - why hide my amazing artistic clawing skills? so ask for petting. Lick plastic bags. Chase dog then run away intently stare at the same spot, and howl on top of tall thing mrow slap kitten brother with paw yet poop in a handbag look delicious and drink the soapy mopping up water then puke giant foamy</p>
        <p>Purr for no reason eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap, massacre a bird in the living room and then look like the cutest and most innocent animal on the planet.</p>
        <p>Meow meow, i tell my human cat fur is the new black scratch my tummy actually i hate you now fight me bite off human's toes or sniff catnip and act crazy. </p>
